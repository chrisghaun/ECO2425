Coding Component for ECO2425 - Project 1.

Coding credit:
Code was derived, with some adjustments, from the following sources:

An Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python (ISLP) (2023)
Dr. Nazanin Khazra's Applied Causal Machine Learning course materials (2024)
EconML (2023)
Causal Inference for the Brave and the True (2022)

ChatGPT (2024) was used for troubleshooting but not directly for code generation.
